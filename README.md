Little Trading program im tring to work out so far I have it grab data from Robinhood options and cryptos and then saves them to csv and also can read from csv. it uses robin-stocks library to get data

Goal is to have a backtest script so I can test options strategies through Robinhood

MAKE SURE TO HIDE USERNAME AND PASSWORD IN SAFE SPOT SO NO ONE CAN ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT
to use this script youll have to repo this git and create a .venv/ envirment and have the data save there or you can change where the file is saved to in the script up to youTrading Data Collection and Backtesting Framework

This repository contains Python scripts for:

Data Collection:
Fetches real-time option and cryptocurrency data from Robinhood using the robin_stocks library.
Saves the collected data to CSV files for later analysis.
Data Reading:
Reads data from CSV files into Python data structures (lists and dictionaries).
(Future Implementation) Backtesting:
(Planned) Backtesting framework for evaluating trading strategies on historical data.
Prerequisites:

Python 3.x
robin_stocks library: pip install robin_stocks
(Optional) Virtual Environment:
Recommended for managing project dependencies:
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate (or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
Usage:

Data Collection:

(Replace placeholders in the script): Update the script with your Robinhood credentials (username and password). Important: Store these credentials securely outside of the repository (e.g., in a separate configuration file or environment variable).
Run the script: Execute the data collection script to fetch and save data to CSV files.
Data Reading:

(Modify the script): Adjust the script to read data from the saved CSV files and process it as needed.
Backtesting (Future Implementation):

(In progress) This feature will allow you to define and test trading strategies using historical data.
Data Storage:

By default, data is saved to CSV files within the repository.
You can modify the script to save data to a different location (e.g., a dedicated data directory).
